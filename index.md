//Coding Best Practices
#1 Declare and initialize variables at the top
#2 Don't make one function do it all - write functions that accomplish one task
#3 Always Use strict on - it will catch errors you would make silently without it
#4 Avoid global variables - aka declare variables inside a function (locally)
#5 Avoid using var to declare variables
#6 Always use “===”
#7 Put effort into naming things
#8 Comment your code often
#9 Avoid "New" as a keyword
#10 for loops are better than .for each sometimes
